# Project Title


Congruent Partitions of Polygons


# Description of Project


We will be examining and attempting to make progress on open problems related to partitions of polygons into pieces which are congruent up to linear transformations, along with generalizations. A partition here need not be covering, although it must be a subset of the original polygon.

Some potential problems:


Decide whether polynomials have partitions with n > 2 pieces such that no area is uncovered. Determine upper bounds for uncovered area in general.


Determine whether partitions exist when congruence is replaced with other groups of symmetry.


# List of References you will be using


We'll be working off of a few sources, and fanning out to their references and citations. There are certainly other papers, but these are still the starting point.

# A detailed timeline


Week 6 - Be prepared with an overview for the project and prepare a presentation to present in class
Week 7 - Finish reading over summary/preliminary papers, find other papers, and create reference list.
Make conjectures and plan approach
Start building simulations

Week 9 - Finish reading additional papers. Workable simulations


Week 11 - Finish simulations


Week 13 - Begin final write-up


# Plan for dividing duties amongst team members?

Duties will be in large part shared between members, but tentatively it will be biased as follows:

Webpage/Writing - Dhvani
Simulations - Ari, Jason
Source finding - Jason
Reading - Everyone
