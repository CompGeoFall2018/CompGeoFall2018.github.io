<p>Congruent Partitions of Polygons</p>
<h1 id="description-of-project">Description of Project</h1>
<p>We will be examining and attempting to make progress on open problems related to partitions of polygons into pieces which are congruent up to linear transformations, along with generalizations. A partition here need not be covering, although it must be a subset of the original polygon.</p>
<p>Some potential problems:</p>
<p>Decide whether polynomials have partitions with n &gt; 2 pieces such that no area is uncovered. Determine upper bounds for uncovered area in general.</p>
<p>Determine whether partitions exist when congruence is replaced with other groups of symmetry.</p>
<h1 id="list-of-references-you-will-be-using">List of References you will be using</h1>
<p>We’ll be working off of a few sources, and fanning out to their references and citations. There are certainly other papers, but these are still the starting point.</p>

<h1 id="a-detailed-timeline">A detailed timeline</h1>
<p>Week 6 - Be prepared with an overview for the project and prepare a presentation to present in class Week 7 - Finish reading over summary/preliminary papers, find other papers, and create reference list. Make conjectures and plan approach Start building simulations</p>
<p>Week 9 - Finish reading additional papers. Workable simulations</p>
<p>Week 11 - Finish simulations</p>
<p>Week 13 - Begin final write-up</p>

<p>Duties will be in large part shared between members, but tentatively it will be biased as follows:</p>
